    <h1>Myanmar coup: Police fire rubber bullets as protesters defy ban</h1>
    <img src= "png/_116874017_hi065596821.jpg">
    <h3>Police in Myanmar have fired rubber bullets during a demonstration in the capital <b>Nay Pyi Taw</b>, as thousands defied a ban on protests.</h3>
    <p>Water cannon and tear gas have also been used against protesters, but reports of live bullet usage are unconfirmed.</p>
    <p>One woman is in hospital in a critical condition with a head wound.</p>
    <p>Protesters are standing against a coup that removed the elected government last week.</p>
    <p>It is the fourth day of consecutive protests. A ban on large public gatherings and night-time curfews has been instigated in some cities, with military leader <b>Min Aung Hlaing</b> warning that no-one is above the law.</p>
    <p>The demonstrators have been demanding the release of elected leader <b>Aung San Suu Kyi</b>, along with senior leaders of her <b>National League for Democracy Party (NLD)</b>. She was arrested when the military seized power.</p>
    <p>The army has declared a year-long state of emergency and claimed, without evidence, that an earlier election was fraudulent.</p>
    <h2>How did the situation escalate?</h2>
    <p>Earlier on Tuesday, police began using water cannon against protesters in <b>Nay Pyi Taw</b>.</p>
    <p>But the crowd withstood the barrage of water fired at them and refused to retreat, according to Reuters news agency.</p>
    <p>"End the military dictatorship," people yelled.</p>
    <p>Warning shots were eventually fired into the air, before rubber bullets were fired at protesters.</p>
    <p>According to <b>BBC Burmese</b>, who spoke to an unnamed medical officer from a <b>Nay Pyi Taw</b> hospital, two protesters were injured. A woman was seriously hurt from a head wound and another demonstrator had chest injuries. It is not yet clear how exactly they were wounded.</p>
    <p>Reuters news agency also spoke with a doctor who said X-rays indicated live ammunition had been used against the woman with critical head injuries.</p>
    <img src= "png/_116874021_hi065596911.jpg">
    <p>There are also numerous unconfirmed reports of police officers crossing over to join protesters. In some areas, police also allowed demonstrators through their barricades.</p>
    <p>The BBC's South East Asia correspondent <b>Jonathan Head</b> said it was clear officers were making a "more determined effort" to disperse protesters.</p>
    <p>Previous protests against the country's decades-long military rule, in <i>1988</i> and <i>2007</i>, saw demonstrators killed.</p>
    <h2>How is the military reacting?</h2>
    <p>On Monday <b>Gen Min Aung Hlaing</b> gave his first televised address since the coup a week earlier. He insisted the seizure of power was justified due to "voter fraud", accusing the electoral commission of failing to investigate irregularities over voter lists in November's election.</p>
    <p>The commission had said there was no evidence to support claims of widespread fraud.</p>
    <p><b>Ms Suu Kyi</b> and various senior leaders from her <b>National League for Democracy (NLD)</b> party, including President <b>Win Myint</b>, were detained on <i>1 February</i>.</p>
    <p><b>Gen Min Aung Hlaing</b> promised new elections overseen by a new "reformed" election commission, and said the military would hand power to the winner.</p>
    <img src= "png/_116868015_mediaitem116868013.jpg">
    <p>He also said his rule would be "different" from what was effectively a 49-year military grip on power that ended in <i>2011</i>.</p>
    <p>He spoke of achieving a "true and disciplined democracy", a phrase that drew scorn from some opponents of the coup on social media.</p>
    <img src= "png/_116752759_myanmarv2640-2x-nc.png">
    <p>On Tuesday, <b>New Zealand</b> announced that it would be suspending all high-level contact with <b>Myanmar</b> and imposing a travel ban on its military leaders.</p>
    <p>The Prime Minister, <b>Jacinda Ardern</b>, also announced restrictions on aid that benefited the military.</p>
    <p>It is the first major international move to isolate the military since they took power.</p>
